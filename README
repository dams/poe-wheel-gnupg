NAME

    POE-Wheel-GnuPG - a GnuPG interface for POE


DESCRIPTION

    POE-Wheel-GnuPG provides a GPG interface to your POE Session. Its main
benefits are that it allows asynchronous encryption and decryption, and allow
you to encrypt or decrypt on the fly, without having to store data in a file,
even when the data is huge.

I recommend using this module :
  - when you use POE and want to use GPG.
  - for security reason, when you have huge data to decrypt and you don't want
    it to be stored in a file

POE-Wheel-GnuPG inherits from GnuPG::Interface, and uses it for GPG actions.
POE-Wheel-GnuPG has a different constructor, but appart from that, you can use
POE-Wheel-GnuPG as you would use GnuPG::Interface, except for the POE signals
of course. See POE-Wheel-GnuPG POD for more information
